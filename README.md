About The Project
"Safe Life" identifies when an elderly person is in distress and calls for help. The system detects person fall, by a "pose detection" algorithm for identifying the movment of the human body. If the system detects a fall, it makes a phone contact with a predefine person: relative, staff member, etc.
For the phone contact, we used the "twilio" library.
